		<support><p>Three major fragments: A-B, which are stone blocks each composed of two joining fragments, and C, possibly related, though see below.</p>
			<p>A: Pale brown poros <rs type="objectType">wall block</rs>, consisting of a pair of joining fragments, which form a corner
inscribed on two faces (left/right). For a fuller description, cf. <bibl type="author_date" n="Iversen forthc.">Iversen forthc.</bibl></p>
			<p>B: A further segment of identical pale brown poros <rs type="objectType">wall block</rs>, consisting of two joining fragments. These join to form an inscribed face, with identical lettering, and with perhaps the left edge of the block preserved. The text on B is too fragmentary and is not reprised here.</p>
			<p>C: <rs type="objectType">Lead tablet</rs>, found in 2 joining pieces.</p>

<p>The text is inscribed boustrophedon on all fragments. On A and B, the letters were originally painted in a red colour. Lines are divided by faint incised registers. On C, the lines are defined by guidelines as in the stone fragments. The traces of a nail hole to affix the tablet also match the stone fragments where nail holes are sometimes visible. </p>

				<head>Commentary</head>
				<p>This is probably the earliest inscribed ritual norm of this collection (but cp. the doubtful <bibl type="abbr" n="NGSL">NGSL</bibl> 6, from Tiryns, late 7th - early 6th century BC), and certainly the earliest sacrificial calendar to have come to light. Despite its extremely fragmentary state, Fragment A apparently begins with the first month of the Corinthian calendar, Phoinikaios (see now Iversen 2017 on this calendar). This is followed by traces of a list of sacrificial animals. Fragment B, not printed here, belongs to the same inscription, but is enigmatic. Fragment C may perhaps be a sort of lead template or copy of the calendar, since the letterforms are smaller yet strikingly similar. Here, the combination of a deity and a sacrificial offering is more clear, though a date is absent. Taken together, however, fragments A and C share the three most basic components of sacrificial calendars: a date, followed by a recipient or deity in the dative, and finally an offering, whether in the nominative or in the accusative (as here; cf. Lupu <bibl type="abbr" n="NGSL">NGSL</bibl>, p. 65-68). A sacrificial verb can either be implied or (less likely) could have been present in one of the many lacunae.</p>

				<p>Line A1: This appears to be the first line of the whole text, or at least a part of it, since it begins at a corner of the block and is not preceded by a previous line-course of boustrophedon letters. The month-name is paralleled at <bibl type="abbr" n="Corinth VIII.1">Corinth VIII.1</bibl> 2, line 1 (200-150 BC), as well as in Corinthian colonies (Bouthrotos; <bibl type="abbr" n="I.Magnesia">I.Magnesia</bibl> 44, from Corcyra), and now by the recently deciphered Antikythera Mechanism, where one of the dials displays a Corinthian calendar beginning with this month, cf. <bibl type="abbr" n="SEG">SEG</bibl> 56, 392.</p>

				<p>Lines A2-3: There are traces here of the offering of three piglets; the restoration [τετό]ρες would also be conceivable if the nominative were used, but we probably have the accusative here; see also βο̑ν in fr. C, which may belong to a same or similar document. Though piglets are often found as a sacrifice, groups of piglets are seldom attested in ritual norms. Three piglets are sacrificed to Kore during Metageitnion, in addition to a ram, in the calendar of the Marathonian Tetrapolis: <ref target="CGRN_56">CGRN 56</ref>, col. II, line 44.</p>

				<p>Line C1: For different readings of this line, still unpublished, see now Iversen 2017: 160 (e).</p>

				<p>Lines C2-3: The Polias epithet is attested especially for Athena and from the sixth century at Argos (<bibl type="abbr" n="LSS">LSS</bibl> 27), as well as in the classical period in Delos (<bibl type="abbr" n="ID">ID</bibl> 15), and of course Athens (cf. <bibl type="abbr" n="SEG">SEG</bibl> 14, 29). The offering probably consists of a cow, though the gender is unclear. The sacrifice of a cow to Athena Polias is paralleled at a later date: <ref target="CGRN_92">CGRN 92</ref> (Athens), and cf. also <bibl type="abbr" n="I.Priene">I.Priene</bibl> 108 and p. 310, lines 264-265 (129-100 BC), 113 + p. 311, line 85 (84-81 BC). But this is not an exclusive sacrifice for the goddess; both at <ref target="CGRN_52">CGRN 52</ref> (Erchia), col. Δ, line 15, and in <ref target="CGRN_85">CGRN 85</ref> (Kos), lines 23-24, she is offered a female sheep.</p>
