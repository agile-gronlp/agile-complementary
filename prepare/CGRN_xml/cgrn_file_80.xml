						<head>Commentary</head>    
						
<p>Though it remains to some degree unclear if Keil's hypothesis that the two fragments belong together is absolutely correct (see above on Support), it is nonetheless clear that they share many points of similarity. Both inscriptions apparently had a similar appearance and format (see above and Layout), and their content has much common ground. Even if one were to suppose that they did not form part of the same stele, then, the two fragments taken together form a small dossier on sacrificial portions and tariffs at Erythrai. Unfortunately, their context is almost completely lost and little can be discerned about it on the basis of the texts themselves. For a detailed regulation  concerning the cult of Asclepius at Erythrai, notably mentioning rules for table-offerings and other portions to be given to the priestly personnel in the case of adult and a suckling animal, cf. here <ref target="CGRN_76">CGRN 76</ref>.</p>
						
	<p>The precise organisation and content of fragment A is not completely clear. It mentions several times breads (lines A1, A7-8), and in one case makes a specific reference to portions which must be placed "on the altar" (line A2). For list of portions to be placed on the altar, apparently juxtaposed with priestly portions, cp. here <ref target="CGRN_103">CGRN 103</ref> (Phrearrhioi). Fragment B also apparently contained lists of sacrificial portions to be provided and mentions in at least one case a prescriptive verb in the imperative (line B7). There are perhaps two sections of the regulations preserved here: first, probably rules for private individuals performing sacrifices (lines B7-10), followed by a short prescription concerning sacrificial tariffs (lines B10-11). For such sacrificial tariffs occurring as part of larger cultic regulations, cp. here <ref target="CGRN_61">CGRN 61</ref> (Athens), and <ref target="CGRN_70">CGRN 70</ref> (Oropos), lines 5-9. As usual here, the tariff for an adult animal is double that of suckling animal (according to the plausible correction of Sokolowski in line 11, adopted by Engelmann and Merkelbach).</p>
												
						
<p>Lines A1-3: As Keil and Sokolowski note, in line 1 a verb denoting the placement of the portions on the altar is a likely restoration, i.e. [τιθένα]|ι or one of its compounds. As Keil also notes, the shoulderblade is attractive restoration in line 2, filling the available space in the stoichedon; alternatives include most prominently the right thigh, κωλῆν. For the role of the shoulderblade in Greek sacrifice, see here <ref target="CGRN_120">CGRN 120</ref> (Sinope), line 8, and esp. <ref target="CGRN_129">CGRN 129</ref> (Patara), lines 4-5. For righthand portions, cf. <ref target="CGRN_182">CGRN 182</ref> (Mytilene), line 9, and <ref target="http://cgrn.ulg.ac.be/CGRN_98/">CGRN 98</ref> (Erythrai), lines A12-16, for the right leg (see Commentary). Cf. also the other righthand (feminine) portion mentioned in lines A5-6. For the tongue, see here <ref target="CGRN_41">CGRN 41</ref> (Chios), line 9; this portion will not have produced much of a burned effect on the altar, and it may subsequently have been granted to the priestly personnel.</p>
										
<p>Lines A4-6: The traces at the beginning of line 4 can only be interpreted as part of the word for a snout. As Engelmann and Merkelbach remark, the word ῥύγχος is typically used of the snout of swine, but in fact it could also be used for the muzzle of any quadruped (cf. <bibl type="abbr" n="LSJ">LSJ</bibl> s.v.); we therefore cannot be sure about the type of animal in question here. For "extremities" of the head such as the snout, see here <ref target="CGRN_39">CGRN 39</ref> (Miletos), lines 10-13, with ref. to <bibl type="abbr" n="I.Didyma">I.Didyma</bibl> 482, lines 4-5 (where they were sold). A portion of the ribs seems to be offered in line 4; for such portions, cp. again here <ref target="CGRN_103">CGRN 103</ref> (Phrearrhioi), line 5.  Accordingly, we should also think of the portion called here νόθη, whose precise interpretation has escaped all of the editors of the text, in connection with the ribs of the animal. Indeed, νόθη was an adjective used to qualify πλεύρη (or
πλευραί), and thus is a technical term of anatomy: the so-called "false ribs", especially the last two bones of the ribcage which are to some degree "floating", connected only to the vertebral column and unfused with the other ribs and the sternum; see esp. Paus. 1.35.6, or e.g. Aret. <title>SA</title> 2.6, for human anatomy). The portions envisaged here remain a bit unclear, though perhaps what was meant was a cut of meat "around the false rib", to be related or distinguished from the portion of the ribs mentioned immediately before. For further discussion of this interpretation and for ribs as sacrificial portions, see Carbon. For the head as a portion, mentioned in line 6, see here <ref target="CGRN_38">CGRN 38</ref> (Chios), line B7.</p>												

<p>Lines B6-7: For the type of cake known as φθόϊς, cf. esp. <ref target="CGRN_76">CGRN 76</ref> (Erythrai), line 22.</p>
						
<p>Lines B8-10: If the restoration is correct (which seems plausible), then private individuals were allowed to keep the skins of sacrificed animals as their prerogative: cp. here <ref target="CGRN_39">CGRN 39</ref> (Miletos), lines 3-8. The portion or portions mentioned as "around the tongue" is intriguing and recalls the phrasing found in lines A4-6 for the false rib. Presumably what is meant here are portions of meat in the throat or around the mouth of the animal. For the left "cheek" (probably a side of the head) granted to a priestess on Chios, cf. here <ref target="CGRN_37">CGRN 37</ref>, line 11. The precise restoration at the end of line 9 remains problematic: were the aforementioned portions to be given "as the <foreign>polis</foreign> does also", or was this a reference to other portions, i.e. that the remainder of the portions was to be given "as the <foreign>polis</foreign> does"?</p>
